    <p><i>Interesting facts about Camel</i></p>

    <ul>

        <li>A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back.</li>
        <li>Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo.</li>
        <li>The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now critically endangered.</li>

        <p><i>Interesting facts about Cicada</i></p>

        <ol>

            <li>Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings. They have an exceptionally loud song, produced in most species by the rapid buckling and unbuckling of drumlike tymbals.</li>
            <li>They typically live in trees, feeding on watery sap from xylem tissue and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark. Most cicadas are cryptic.</li>
            <li>The cicadas (/sɪˈkɑːdə/ or /sɪˈkeɪdə/) are a superfamily</li>
